        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          Born in 1964, Dr. Karl Ulrich Volz completed his dental studies at Ulm
          University, where he concluded his dissertation on detecting
          components of dental amalgam in the dental pulp of individuals with
          amalgam fillings. He then spent his assistantship at the "Süddeutsches
          Zentrum für Orale Implantologie" before founding a purely private
          practice in 1991, becoming Germany's youngest dentist at the time.

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          In 1998, he obtained certifications in Biological Dentistry, followed
          by Implantology in 1999. A year later, Dr. Volz founded the BODENSEE
          ZAHNKLINIK with up to 12 dentists and inpatient care. From 2001 to
          2004, he developed the Z-Look zirconia implant, one of the first
          approved ceramic implants, leading to the establishment of Z-Systems
          in 2004.

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-12">
          Continuing his pioneering efforts, he introduced ultrasound implants
          in 2006, followed by ultrasound-assisted membrane technology for bone
          augmentation in 2007 (Sonic Weld).

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          Since 2007, he has been at the forefront of developing the latest
          generation of immediate ceramic implants, leading to the founding of
          SDS Swiss Dental Solutions AG, which is now the world leader among
          ceramic implant manufacturers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          From 2002 to 2012, Dr. Volz developed the first two-part ceramic
          implants, now with higher strength values than comparable titanium
          implants. Further innovations include the development of the latest
          generation of single-piece hybrid implants in 2013–2014.
        </p>
        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          In 2014, he assumed the role of founding president of the renowned
          International Society of Metal-Free Implantology (ISMI). The next
          logical step came in 2016 with the founding of the SWISS BIOHEALTH
          CLINIC for biological dentistry and medicine in Kreuzlingen, as well
          as the SWISS BIOHEALTH EDUCATION CENTERS in 2017, attracting over
          4,000 participants annually.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          From 2017 to 2019, Dr. Volz dedicated himself to the development of
          Bone Growing Implants and the BISS Bone Implant Stabilization System.
          Seamlessly, he proceeded with the development and introduction of the
          ad-hoc navigation system Anatomical Implant Method (AIM) and the
          Aesthetic Reconstruction Procedure (RAP), and published the Guided
          Augmentation Procedures (GAP) manual with his surgeons at the Swiss
          Biohealth Clinic, along with corresponding training courses with
          hands-on and live surgeries. In 2021, he published his LONGEVITY FAST
          TRACK GUIDE in German and English.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          In 2022, the most precise Fully Guided Navigation system, SDSBOX, was
          developed and accredited by the CleanImplant Foundation as the first
          navigation system ever. Additionally, both the SDSAIM ad hoc
          navigation system and the 1.2_BRIGHT_2.2 ceramic implant system
          received CleanImplant accreditation, with the implant system being the
          first in the world to receive dual CleanImplant certification
          (production and manufacturing).{" "}

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          At the end of 2023, Dr. Volz welcomed one of the leading PE investors
          in the medical industry, "Gilde Healthcare," as well as leading
          industry experts as partners in his company, SDS Swiss Dental
          Solutions, to further accelerate and professionalize the development
          of the implant company.{" "}

        <p className="text-primary-600 text-[16px] font-[300] max-w-[600px] mb-6">
          With a remarkable track record, Dr. Volz has placed over 30,000
          ceramic implants since 2001, establishing himself as a leader in his
          field.
